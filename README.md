# Data Cleaning - Women's Helpline (180)

### About "Ligue 180"

"Ligue 180" is a Brazilian service channel that receives reports of violence against women throughout the national territory. By dialing 180, you can report a case of violence, which will be forwarded to the competent authorities, and obtain the necessary support and guidance. You can also request assistance for yourself or someone you know in a vulnerable situation, as well as ask for general information about women's rights present in the legislation.

### Main goals
In this project, we will clean the data from Ligue 180 so that in the future, we can answer some questions related to violence against women in Brazil:

- What is the current map of violence against women in Brazil?

- What are the most common types of crimes reported through Ligue 180?

- How has the number of crimes against women grown in recent years?

- What is the general profile of the victims reported in Ligue 180?

- The answers to these questions will be presented in an interactive dashboard, along with data from other years and semesters.

- The step-by-step data cleaning process for Ligue 180 will be explained in the Jupyter Notebook.
